HprK P also catalyzes the pyrophosphate-producing, inorganic phosphate-dependent dephosphorylation (phosphorolysis) of seryl-phosphorylated HPr (P- Ser-HPr). The two antagonistic activities of HprK P are regulated by several intracellular metabolites, which change their concentration in response to the absence or presence of rapidly metabolisable carbon sources (glucose, fructose, etc.) in the growth medium. Therefore, by controlling the phosphorylation state of HPr, HPrK P is a sensor enzyme that plays a major role in the regulation of carbon metabolism and sugar transport it mediates carbon catabolite repression (CCR), and regulates PTS-catalyzed carbohydrate uptake and inducer exclusion",R7A2020_01250,270743,271744,1002,1,FALSE,0.0727699530516432,0.0492957746478873,0.0457746478873239,0.0751173708920188,0.0328638497652582,0.0457746478873239,NE,NE,NE,0.163145539906103,0.152582159624413,NE,NA

Catalysis occurs through a double-displacement mechanism. The nucleophile active site attacks the C1' of nucleotide 34 to detach the guanine base from the RNA, forming a covalent enzyme-RNA intermediate. The proton acceptor active site deprotonates the incoming PreQ1, allowing a nucleophilic attack on the C1' of the ribose to form the product. After dissociation, two additional enzymatic reactions on the tRNA convert PreQ1 to queuine (Q), resulting in the hypermodified nucleoside queuosine (7-(((4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2- cyclopenten-1-yl)amino)methyl)-7-deazaguanosine)",tgt,3727457,3728587,1131,1,FALSE,0.053014553014553,0.0498960498960499,0.0436590436590437,0.0592515592515593,0.0322245322245322,0.0280665280665281,NE,NE,NE,0.138253638253638,0.126819126819127,NE,NA
